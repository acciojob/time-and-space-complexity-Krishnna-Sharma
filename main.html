	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. It is crucial for designing efficient algorithms, as it helps us understand how an algorithm's performance scales with the size of input data.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to execute, including the input size and auxiliary variables. An example of this is an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n), where n represents the size of the input data.
